Virtual memory basically helps out your computer''s RAM by taking on some of the data it needs to hold so it won''t become overwhelmed so to speak. RAM is actually a component which is physically installed in your computer, where Virtual Memory is actually specially allocated space on your hard disk.\r\n\r\nWindows actually tricks the microprocessor into thinking that this space on the hard disk is actually the same thing as RAM so it treats it as RAM. Of course data in Virtual Memory is retrieved much slower than data in RAM because RAM uses electrical signals to transmit information and data where the hard disk uses read/write heads to input and retrieve data onto the disk. Information kept in virtual memory is stored in a special place called the Page File. The pagefile.sys is hidden so that it can''t be accidentally deleted or corrupt, it is not recommended to manipulate your page file unless you know what you are doing.\r\n\r\nYou can actually set how much space on your hard disk you want to allocate for Page File usage by following these steps...\r\n\r\n(Windows XP)\r\n\r\n   1.

It is a common misconception that memory and hard disk space are thought to be one in the same, but in reality they are two totally different components with totally different characteristics and duties.', 'Memory is just another word for the technical term RAM (Random Access Memory). It is basically a holding place for data so it can be easily retrieved by the microprocessor. Unlike a Hard Disk, RAM is volatile meaning when you turn your computer off, whatever is stored in your memory (RAM) is lost. Please do not get memory confused with hard disk space, they are two totally different things. There are many different types of RAM, which usually fall into these two main categories: Static RAM and Dynamic RAM. To keep it simple the main differences between the two are speed, space, and price. Static RAM is much faster than Dynamic RAM because Static RAM doesn''t have to continually refresh as Dynamic RAM does. Static RAM is generally also capable of holding much more information than Dynamic RAM. With that being said you can see Static RAM is generally more expensive than Dynamic RAM.\r\n\r\nEvery time you open a program, your adding data to your holding place (memory). The more programs and processes you have running at the same time, the more memory you are taking up, and the slower your computer''s performance will be.\r\n\r\nSo say your computer has 512 MB''s (Megabytes) of RAM and you take a look at your processes and you are using about 400 MB''s or memory, you may want to close some programs. When you get to the point where you have used up almost all of your memory and virtual memory, your computer with give you a message stating that you cannot open anymore programs or applications until your close some of the ones you have running.\r\n\r\nYou can see how much RAM you have by following these steps...\r\n\r\n(Windows XP)\r\n\r\n1.

It is the record keeper of all that is stored and where it is stored on the system. Keeping the registry clean will keep your computer running smoothly.', 'Windows uses a system called the system registry.This is a central database that is used by all modern Windows platforms. This registry or central hierarchal database contains all the information that is required by the operating system to configure the system and make it operate efficiently. The operating system constantly refers to the registry for information. This may be several times a minute and the information sought may range from user profiles, which applications are installed on the machine, to what hardware is installed and which ports are registered and used for what service. The system registry was introduced in the late 1990''s along with Windows ninety-five and replaced the older version of recording data in INI files. The entire registry is composed of binary code and keeps on growing as the operating system adds entries to it. This slows down the system and it needs a registry cleaner to erase all the useless sentries to make the system more efficient.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Registry?\r\n\r\nAs we use the computer the operating system keeps updating the registry with the new data it has to refer to for smooth operation. Let us take for example the simple file saving information, when we save a document the system has to record where the document has been saved and when it was saved also by which user. All this information is entered in the system registry. No consider how many times you save a document on the system. In addition to this consider how many sites you access on the Internet. Each time you open a site entries are made in the system registry. This makes the registry grow and slow down. Registry cleaners are programs that scan the registry and remove all the redundant entries. Registry Cleaners such as Windows registry cleaner is programmed to identify redundant entries and remove them. This makes the system faster.\r\n\r\nSo How Does The Registry Slow The System?\r\n\r\nAs the programs refer to the registry for information such as the location of a particular file or folder it has to start rummaging through the file from the beginning until it comes to the file entry it is looking for. All the entries are entered in hierarchical order so every time the programs refer to the registry they have to start from the beginning. They will also have to go through the broken links and useless entries, which number many thousands. This is why the registry slows the system. A registry cleaner like Win XP registry Cleaner scans the registry and identifies all the broken links and redundant entries that are entries not associated with any application, and removes them. This speeds the system up greatly.\r\n\r\nAuthor is admin and technical expert associated with development of computer security and performance enhancing software like Registry Cleaner, Anti Spyware, Window Cleaner, Anti Spam Filter.

For Example, connecting two home computers so they can share data creates a simple network. Companies can have networks consisting of a few dozen computers or hundreds of computers. The Internet is the world''s largest network and connects millions of computers all over the world.\r\n\r\nLogging On\r\nNetwork users are usually required to identify themselves before they can gain access to the information on a network. This is known as logging on. Each user must enter a personalized user name and password to access a network. By keeping this information secret, users can prevent unauthorized people from accessing the network.\r\n\r\nSharing Information\r\nYou can use a network to share information with other people. Information can be ant form of data, such as a document created in a word processing program, a picture drawn in an imaging application or information from a database. Before networks, people often used floppy disks or any other storage device to exchange information between computers, which was a slow and unreliable process. With networks, exchanging information between computers is quick and easy.\r\n\r\nSharing Resources\r\nComputers connected to a network can share equipment and devices, called resources. The ability to share resources the cost of buying computer hardware. For example, instead of having to buy a printer for each person on a network, everyone can share one central printer.\r\n\r\nSharing Programs\r\nNetworks allow people to access programs stored on a central computer, such a s a spreadsheet or word processing program. Individuals can use their own computers to access and work with the programs. By sharing a program, a company can avoid having to install a copy of the program on each person''s computer.', 17, 1, 1),

This simulation of motion is done when each image continues in a very gradual manner to show the next image, step by step.\r\n\r\nWhat happens in animation is that motion is simulated in a way that the eyes tend to believe that actual motion has taken place while the fact is the perceived sense of motion is only because of the consecutive images that are passed through very fast.\r\n\r\nYou already may know that computer animation comprises 2D animation and computer 3d animation.\r\n\r\nThe traditional aspect of computer animation as an art form is well established in the application of 2D animation or two-dimensional animation is the more traditional face of the art form. In 2D animation, whatever drawings are done or created on paper are utilized and so are celluloid transparencies. In this form, it is also termed as cell animation and hand-drawn animation.\r\n\r\nLet''s get back to our main area of interest namely 3D animation which emerged as a new kind of art form that depends more on computers to bring forth characters or objects using a construct environment that is three dimensional in nature. So instead of any kind of hand drawings, the characters are all created within the computer not anywherelse because the character is subject to further modifications or manipulations in the online environment using highly advanced computer tools.\r\n\r\nSo if your ambition is to create your own remarkably unique 3D characters and animations, you should then procure a very good quality 3D animation software and we assume that you already have a good computer. Be aware of the fact that most studios currently make use of proprietary computer 3d animation software but for a beginner like yourself, you can check out a whole variety of software options in computer 3d animation.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that a lot of these off-the-shelf computer animation packages are helpful but they differ in the levels of complexity and features that come along with them. So it would be advisable to learn computer 3d animation as well as the basic principles of 2D before you actually go out and get yourself any package.\r\n\r\nAnimation packages are plenty but some brands like Maya remain immortal because of its high-end 3D computer graphics as well as its highly powerful 3D modeling software package. This is so popular with the film as well as the entertainment industry so it''s a good choice. Take note that Maya has two versions, namely Maya Complete as well as Maya Unlimited. The former is less powerful and the latter is considered highly powerful and expensive. So it would be best to choose only according to your requirements as an animator.', 68, 1, 1),

As of November 07, IE holds 57% of the browser market while Firefox holds around 36%. However, Firefox is growing rapidly and if it continues to do so at the same pace it will have over-taken IE within two years.\r\n\r\nFirefox has often introduced new features before Internet Explorer has, and this has no doubt fueled its popularity, especially among "power-users", people who are well acquainted with computers. Tabbed browsing is probably the best example of this. Although Mozilla did not come up with the idea they implemented tabs well before Internet Explorer did and used it as a major selling-point. Another major and innovative feature introduced was applications - extensions made by the community to add to the feature-set.\r\n\r\nHowever, Microsoft, clearly aware of the threat Firefox poses on IE, included many of the features that made Firefox unique, such as tabbed browsing and RSS feeds in their latest implementation of their browser, IE7. One of the advantages that IE posses is its reduced start-up time compared to Firefox, as part of the program is loaded as Windows boots.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons that Internet Explorer has enjoyed such a large market share for such a long time is that IE comes bundled with Microsoft Windows. Yet the market share that Firefox possesses is increasing, as more and more people become aware of IE alternatives and their benefits, no doubt fueled by the media''s critical eye on the lack of security in the latest IE browsers.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the days of Internet Explorer dominating the browser market are numbered, as more and more people make the switch more IE to Firefox. Yet as Microsoft plays catch-up, and starts to match the features present in Firefox, there is no indication of which browser will lead the future of web browsing.', 202, 1, 1),
(9, 3, '2008-01-12 21:39:19', '2008-01-12 00:00:00', 'Dell UltraSharp 3008 WFP 30" Widescreen LCD', 'Like high-end graphics cards setup in multi-GPU configurations, terabyte desktop drives, and 3GHz quad-core processors, 30-inch wide screen LCDs cater to what we like to call the "enthusiast" niche.', 'Like high-end graphics cards setup in multi-GPU configurations, terabyte desktop drives, and 3GHz quad-core processors, 30-inch wide screen LCDs cater to what we like to call the "enthusiast" niche.  And though this niche obviously drives lower volume demand versus the mainstream, you have to remember that the enthusiast end-user is a very influential segment of the market, often times assisting in the definition of what will become mainstream technology tomorrow.  Not to mention 30 inches of screen real-estate is a professional workstation designer''s nirvana, so perhaps this niche isn''t as small as it would appear on the surface. \r\n\r\nRegardless, though there are fewer in our audience who might find it practical to justify the cost of a 30" monitor, the undeniable allure of a panel of this size makes these products easily one of our most popular areas of coverage here at HotHardware.com.  There''s just something about them.  Maybe it''s a size thing.  We''ve got people buzzing over tiny, little Eee PCs and they''re also in a tizzy at the other end of the spectrum about huge LCDs.  Sexy is in the extremes we would surmise, though the ever-present "newness" factor is obviously a head-turner for these products as well.\r\n\r\nIt''s easy to see where Dell was going with the introduction of their new UltraSharp 3008 WFP 30" LCD.  Calling upon the input received from previous 30" panel incarnations and marrying these feature requests in with new technologies like a wider color gamut and the bleeding-edge of display interface technologies.  As the first DisplayPort-enabled LCD from Dell, the 3008 WFP is claiming that sexy is back.  No Justin, not you -- she''s getting a Dell?\r\n\r\nDiagonal Size 	30 inches\r\nDisplay Type 	Active Matrix - TFT LCD\r\nColor Gamut 	117%\r\nImage Scaling 	Built in image scaler/processor\r\nDepth 	9.35 inches\r\nHeight 	\r\n18.98 inches compressed\r\n22.52 inches extended\r\nWidth 	27.43 inches\r\nWeight (with stand) 	34.36 lbs.\r\nStand Adjustability 	Tilt, Swivel, Height Adjustable\r\nHorizontal Viewing Angle 	178o (typical)\r\nVertical Viewing Angle 	178o (typical)\r\nColor Support 	16.7 million colors\r\nContrast Ratio 	3000:1\r\nResponse Time 	\r\n8 ms (grey-to-grey)\r\nBrightness 	370 cd/m2\r\nResolution 	2560x1600 (max)\r\nPixel Pitch (Dot Pitch) 	0.2505 mm\r\nPorts 	\r\nAnalog, DVI-D (dual link) with HDCP x2, S-Video, Composite, Component, HDMI, DisplayPort\r\nUSB 2.0 (4)\r\n9-in-2 Media Card Reader\r\nKensington security port\r\nPower Consumption 	\r\n250W(max)\r\nLess than 2W switched off \r\n\r\nTaking what we know of Dell''s previous 30" LCD product, the 3007 WFP HC, you''ll note that there are more than a few upgrades provided with this newer 3008 version. Specifically, the 3008 WFP now has a 117% color gamut, in addition to having a 3000:1 contrast ratio versus the 1000:1 performance of its predecessor.  The panel also comes with the same pixel response time of 8ms but now has enhanced brightness capability at 370 cd/m2 (or nits if you prefer) versus 300 for the previous 3007 model.  Finally, Dell also heard our plea back when they introduced the 3007 WFP, and saw fit to adding significantly more connectivity to the panel, with not only two DVI-D inputs, but also HDMI, Composite, Component, S-Video and the new DisplayPort interface.  In short, anything you could want to hook up now or in the future, can be hooked up to this new Dell 30" panel.  Bravo, Dell, bravo.', 20, 1, 1),

And his barren wife  (Jennifer Garner, never better) craves parenthood so much, she''s almost  painful to watch. </p>\r\n<p>Movies about teenagers tend to traffic in stereotypes, but  that''s definitely not the case here. Juno has an incredibly supportive,  working-class dad and stepmom - an HVAC specialist and nail technician  - played with great skill and subtlety by J.K. Simmons and Allison  Janney. </p>\r\n<p>Page is so deft at delivering self-deprecating quips (the  increasingly pregnant Juno is known around school as a &quot;cautionary  whale&quot;) that you''re almost surprised when she plumbs the character''s  emotions. She may well end up with a Best Actress nomination. </p>\r\n<p>Besides coping with her humiliation over her physical condition, Juno has got to sort out her feelings for the smitten Paulie. </p>\r\n<p>She coolly holds the kid at arm''s length while dealing with more  pressing matters - much to the distress of the inarticulate Paulie,  portrayed with a devastating lack of guile by &quot;Superbad&quot; star Cera. </p>\r\n<p>Screenwriter Cody - a former stripper turned blogger - has a  terrific ear for dialogue, and she gives many of the best lines to  Juno''s BFF Leah (Olivia Thirlby), who functions as the flick''s  one-woman Greek chorus. </p>\r\n<p>Director Reitman gets all the details right - compare Juno''s  modest digs with the prospective parents'' McMansion - and adds many  visual grace notes, including Paulie''s colorfully costumed track team,  which reappears throughout as a comic leitmotif. </p>\r\n<p>Most importantly, the filmmakers and ensemble put &quot;Juno&quot; on an  emotional roller coaster that not only had me doubled over in laughter  but, more importantly, crying at the end. </p>', 1264, 48, 1);
