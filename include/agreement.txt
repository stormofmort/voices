These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you.  Please read them.  They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any.  The terms also apply to any Microsoft

• updates, 
• supplements, 
• Internet-based services, and
• support services

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items.  If so, those terms apply.

BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.  INSTEAD, RETURN IT TO THE RETAILER FOR A REFUND OR CREDIT.  If you cannot obtain a refund there, contact Microsoft or the Microsoft affiliate serving your country for information about Microsoft’s refund policies.  See www.microsoft.com/worldwide.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW FOR EACH LICENSE YOU ACQUIRE.

1. OVERVIEW.
   a. Software.  The software includes development tools, software programs and documentation.
   b. License Model.  The software is licensed on a per user basis.

2. PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION KEYS.  The software requires a key to install or access it.  You are responsible for the use of keys assigned to you.  You should not share the keys with third parties. 

3. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS
   a. General.  One user may install and use copies of the software to design, develop, test and demonstrate web sites you develop.  
   b. Included Microsoft Programs.  These license terms apply to all Microsoft programs included with the software.  If the license terms with any of those programs give you other rights that do not expressly conflict with these license terms, you also have those rights.

4. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
   a. Content Files.  The software contains code that you are permitted to incorporate into web sites you develop if you comply with the terms below.

      i. Right to Use and Sublicense.  The items listed below are “Content Files.”
       • Templates.  The software includes web site design templates.  You may copy, modify and incorporate the templates into the web sites you develop.

       • Sample Code. You may copy, modify, and incorporate into your web sites the source and object code form of code marked as “Code Snippets”.
	
You may permit the owners of the web sites you develop to use any Content Files as part of those web sites.  A web hosting service provider’s caching of the Content Files as part of those web sites is also permitted.

     ii. Sublicense Requirements.  For any Content Files you incorporate into a website, you must
       • display your valid copyright notice on your web sites; and
       • indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, from third parties related to your incorporation into such web site, or modification, of the Content Files.

       • include Content Files in malicious, deceptive or unlawful websites; 
       • create or design obscene or scandalous web sites with the software as defined by federal law at the time the web site was created or designed; or

5.  TRIAL AND CONVERSION.  Some or all of the software may be licensed on a trial basis.  Your rights to use trial software are limited to the trial period.  The trial software and length of the trial period are set forth during the activation process.  You may have the option to convert your trial rights to subscription or perpetual rights.  Conversion options will be presented to you at the expiration of your trial period.  After the expiration of any trial period without conversion, most features of the trial software will stop running.  At that time you can continue to open, view and print any documents you created with the trial software.

6. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.  Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software.  It may change or cancel them at any time.  You may not use these services in any way that could harm them or impair anyone else’s use of them.

7. SCOPE OF LICENSE.  The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software.  Microsoft reserves all other rights.  Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.  In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways.  For more information, see www.microsoft.com/licensing/userights.  You may not

       • work around any technical limitations in the software;

10. ACADEMIC EDITION SOFTWARE.  You must be a “Qualified Educational User” to use software marked as “Academic Edition” or “AE.”   If you do not know whether you are a Qualified Educational User, visit www.microsoft.com/education or contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country.

11. PROOF OF LICENSE.  If you acquired the software on a disc or other media, a genuine Microsoft Proof of License label with a genuine copy of the software identifies licensed software.  To be valid, this label must appear on Microsoft packaging.  If you receive the label separately, it is invalid. You should keep the packaging that has the label on it to prove that you are licensed to use the software.  To identify genuine Microsoft software, see www.howtotell.com.

12. TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY.  The first user of the software may transfer it, and this agreement, directly to a third party.  Before the transfer, that party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software.  The transfer must include the software and the Proof of License label.  The first user must uninstall the software before transferring it separately from the device.  The first user may not retain any copies.

13. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations.  You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software.  These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.  For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.

14. SUPPORT SERVICES.  Microsoft provides support services for the software as described at www.support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx.

15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement (including the warranty below), and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

16. APPLICABLE LAW.
   a. United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.  The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
   b. Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.

17. LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights.  You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country.  You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software.  This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.

18. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES.  YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to

      • anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
      • claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if
      • repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses; or
      • Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
